Simple showcase project showing weather data written in react-redux-thunk

It gets weather data from the API provided by [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/).

And it gets icons using node package [Open Weather Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-weather-icons).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
